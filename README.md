Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases a collection of my personal projects, highlighting my experience in various areas such as data cleaning, API pulling, and SQL analysis. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply these skills to real-world data challenges and solutions.

Overview of Skills

- Data Cleaning: Working with raw datasets to clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis. Projects include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
  
- API Pulling: Extracting data from APIs for analysis or integration into applications. This includes working with RESTful APIs to collect and process real-time data from various sources.
  
- SQL Analysis: Writing complex SQL queries to analyze and manipulate large datasets. Projects include data aggregation, filtering, and generating insights from structured data.

- Machine Learning for Classification: Applying machine learning techniques to classify data. This includes working with algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVM) for tasks like predicting categories or classes based on input features.
